Merge Sort in Ten Languages

Purely as an exercise of interest, I'm writing mergesort algorithms in 10 languages to help appreciate the difference in some of the less common languages from the common ones.

The languages (initially) are:
- C
- C++
- Objective-C
- Java
- Python
- Haskell
- Scheme
- ...I'll have to think of the rest.
